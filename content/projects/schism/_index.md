Even as I continue to focus most of my energy on [FullStory](/projects/fullstory),
I can't help but spend a little time tinkering on game projects. This was a simple
prototype I implemented as part of the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/)
2022, where the theme was "duality".

I like the way it turned out, but I haven't had as much time as I'd like to take
it any further than the [initial prototype](https://j15r.itch.io/schism). Mostly
because I have a horrible tendency to get distracted by tangents, mechanics,
rewriting bits and pieces, and other shiny objects. I've only posted a single
update so far, but hope to get my act back together soon.  There is also a
(nearly zero traffic) [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Sj2H3wQB), and a
public [issue tracker](https://open.codecks.io/schism) that's woefully out of
date.
