I worked at [Lotus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Software) for several quarters as an intern
in the early 90s. This was in Atlanta, where they built the
[Ami Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Lotus_Word_Pro) word processor. It started life as the
Am√≠ word processor created by [Samna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samna), and aquired by Lotus
in 1990.

At the time I started, Ami Pro 3 had just been released, and work on the Ami Pro 4 release had just begun.
The team was shifting from a simple, monolithic codebase in Windows 3 C code, to a complete rewrite in
C++ split across several platforms -- Windows 3.1, NT, OS/2, Unix, and MacOS.

I spent my time working on the import/export file filters, and eventually porting some of the vector
graphics code over to the new code base. It was a fascinating experience, especially at a time so
close to the outset of the commercial Internet. A lot of it was old-school DOS/Windows development,
sneaker-net, monochrome debug monitors, and no source control. At the same time, we had Lotus Notes
running across the company WAN with the headquarters in Cambridge, where we had distributed email
and bug tracking.

They eventually cancelled the Mac port of Ami Pro 4, to focus on the other ports (in a fit of bad
decision making, the company decided there was more of a future in the Unix and OS/2 ports!). Two
members of the Mac team left to form Pixel Technologies. I ended up joining them to work on
some contract game development projects, because they'd often seen me taking advantage of the
monochrome debug monitor at work to make it easier to crack games :)
