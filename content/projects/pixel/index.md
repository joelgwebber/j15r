This was the little game company formed by two members of the Mac team at Lotus.
The company did varied contract work, including the Windows port of Western
Technologies' [Trivial Pursuit](https://www.mobygames.com/game/trivial-pursuit-interactive-multimedia-game)
(Yes, they really did think it was a good idea to call it an "interactive
multimedia game"; what can I say, it was the 90s).

I also got to work on a very early version of the
[3DO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer) development
kit. It was my first time working on a console development kit, cross-compiling
C++ to run on the tiny 16 MHz ARM processor on that machine. I can't say that we
produced anything really _great_, but I did write the graphics engine for what
is arguably one of the weirdest games in existence,
[Cyberdillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdillo).

I wasn't still with the company when they recorded [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkjWFoD3PIg) that adorns the end of the
game, but I knew everyone in it well. Believe it or not I can completely imagine
the process that led to this getting made!
