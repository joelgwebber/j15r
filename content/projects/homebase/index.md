There's a longer story behind all of this, but the short version is that in
2012 a few of us left Google to start something new. We didn't quite know what
it was going to be, and we eventually ended up with something we called
Homebase. It was trying to be a kind of project management system, initially
focused on marketing teams. The UI was pretty slick, and it was nicely
collaborative and interactive; but it never really found its audience, and we
were running on savings, so we couldn't afford to keep working on it while it
wandered the wilderness in search of one.

Fortunately for us, we were also tinkering on the early prototype of what would
eventually become [FullStory](/projects/fullstory), where we would learn what
_real_ "product market fit" looked like.
