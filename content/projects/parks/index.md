At the beginning of the pandemic lockdown, many of us were starting to work from
home a _lot_. Looking for something relaxing to listen to, I stumbled across a
collection of recordings from U.S. National Parks (courtesy of the Sound and
Light Ecology Team at Colorodo State University).

I decided to put together a simple sound board page that lets you choose your
own mix of these recordings, for nice, relaxing background listening. Here's a
[direct link](/parks) for you to bookmark and enjoy at leisure.
