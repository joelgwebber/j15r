Innuvo was a small startup founded by Bruce Johnson, who I'd worked with at
AppForge. I joined in 2003, and we focused on building tools to allow developers
to build complex, dynamic web applications in Java. While it may seem like a bit
of an odd approach now, it's hard to explain just how difficult it was to
develop sophisticated applications in Javascript. Any tooling would have been an
improvement on that state of affairs.

We only had a couple of customers when our little company got acquired by Google,
and the technology went on to become the basis for the Google Web Toolkit.

I've included below some of the blog posts I wrote during that time. They were a
result of things we learned during the process of building these tools, as well
as the need to bring some attention to our nascent company. Most of the
information in them is only of historical interest at this point.
