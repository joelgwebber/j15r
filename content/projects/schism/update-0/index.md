The idea for this little game started with the 2022 Global Game Jam. The theme
was “duality”, and I’ve always been fascinated with the [“map/territory
relation”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation)
explored by [Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science) and
others. I decided to explore what it might be like if the map were the
territory, and this is the result.

So far I’m pretty happy with it. The goal of the prototype is simple – learn how
to change the world so you can get out. The visual theme is dungeon-like, simply
because I happened to have assets of that form available (and I’m not much of an
artist).

I don’t yet know what I want the underlying fiction to be, but I’m toying with
the idea that you find yourself trapped at the bottom of a half-finished
dungeon, in a kind of inversion of Rogue. One wonders how (and why) anyone would
construct something as large and complex as a typical video game dungeon, and
perhaps the magic of their construction lies in the creation of models that then
manifest in the dungeon’s constructs. And what if you found yourself in one
where something went wrong partway through construction, leaving the models and
other detritus lying about? I like the idea of telling a story through the
remains of this process, and with a little Terry Pratchett style humor, with a
touch of the old [Dungeon
Keeper](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dungeon-keeper), for those who remember
the 90s.

Just a rough idea at this point, but I think it could be fun. There are a lot of
interesting challenges and puzzles one can explore with these parts. I created a
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/Sj2H3wQB), and a public [issue
tracker](https://open.codecks.io/schism) (mostly for my own purposes, but feel
free to comment and vote if you like). Feel free to follow along if you want to
look over my shoulder, or offer ideas. I’d love to hear them!
