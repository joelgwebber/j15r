In the mid-90s, I worked at a small game studio called Heuristic Park, founded
by [D.W. Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Bradley), who designed
and developed Wizardry 5, 6, and 7. The game we built was codenamed "deep 6",
and ultimately released by Activision under the title _[Wizards &
Warriors](https://www.gog.com/en/game/wizards_warriors)_ (I'm not sure how it
ended up with such a bland title).

I worked with my friend Jamey Pittman to build the game's core systems and
graphics engine, while Bradley and later other engineers worked on the gameplay
systems. It was a long and fraught development process, with a lot of long hours
as we all scrambled to realize the vision, which was often frustrated by the
limited hardware of the time.

This was exacerbated by significant changes in PC gaming hardware in the late
90s. When we started, we had to implement all rendering in software, hand-
rolling inner loops in carefully optimized x86 code. By the time the game
actually shipped, 3D accelerated rendering had become fairly commonplace. This
led to difficult tradeoffs, between the way we had designed the game and its
assets for the world we started with, and the ways they had to be adapted to the
world the game shipped in.

The resulting game was something of a flawed gem, and didn't make much of an
impact. But I was pleasantly surprised to discover this [YouTube

where the author plays through the entire game, and seems to really enjoy it.
