After joining Google in 2005, I went on to work with Bruce Johnson to build
what came to be called the [Google Web Toolkit](https://www.gwtproject.org/).
We formed an engineering team, joining an existing sales team to form the
Google Atlanta office.

I had the opportunity to work with many amazing people and teams, and was easily
the greatest single experience for my growth as an engineer. I was able to
contribute to a number of different projects, include the AdWords UI rewrite,
[Google Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave), Chrome, and quite a
few others.

I also got in the habit of using GWT to port games to the web, as the platform
became more capable, including [Quake II](/projects/quake2), [Angry
Birds](/projects/angrybirds), and [Minecraft](/projects/minecraft).

  - I can't seem to find the presentation Bruce and I gave here,
    but if anyone has a copy, please let me know.

During this period, I also published a few blog posts, now likely only of
minor historical interest:
