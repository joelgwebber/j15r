When Randall Munroe's XKCD published [this clock](https://xkcd.com/1335/), I decided
I just had to have it on my desktop. I took the images and wrapped them in a bit of
script to keep the rotation of the center up to date. It also adds the ability to
select a time zone to see the actual time there.

Here's a [direct link](/xkclock) to the page, so you can do with it as you see
fit. I originally had it running in a MacOS widget, but those are long dead at
this point.
