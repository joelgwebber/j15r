This was my first "real" job beyond flipping burgers -- working phone support
for [ZSoft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZSoft_Corporation), a small software
company that made products like PC Paintbrush and Publisher's TypeFoundry. If you're
old enough, you may remember the old [PCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX) image
format, which came out of ZSoft. Somewhat more famously, it was also the origin of
the Windows paint program everyone loves to hate --
[MS Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint#History).

This was in the days before the Internet had escaped university labs, so it was
all phone support, mailing floppies, and occasionally getting a customer to dial
into a BBS running on a couple of phone lines in our office closet. The experience
was great for learning how to communicate with people effectively, and working through
issues over the phone, usually with technically unsophisticated customers. And this
was back in the days when every printer, scanner, and video card had its own interface
card, with all the attendant drivers, ports, and IRQ conflicts, so it was a challenge!
